# Portfolio2 _The updated portfolio_ 

## Development diary
### May20 2018
Began brainstorming a few weeks ago, did some new wireframes but class assignement got in the way somewhat.
Yesterday and today I finalized some of the user flow. It was a sticking point for me for some time.
I struggled with resolving my original design of 4 panels [Original portfolio link](https://deezye.github.io/folio2018/)
I knew that the site was created from the design first, and I had wrested the UX into the design rather than starting with UX first - a mistake. So I really wanted to get to the core of what I wanted from a site. 
Here's what I wanted:
- A simple design, one page was my original idea
- Conveyed my personality strongly. I want the user to know me by browsing the site
- Retro / Vaporwave / Bold colors. I want the site to stand out
- Mobile first. But still look good on desktop

Here's the Flow graph (sort of) mixed with basic wireframe idea for UX. Single page, Mobile-first, responsive.
